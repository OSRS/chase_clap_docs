# OSRS Open Projects Roadmap

OSRS Open focuses on technologies relating to any domain, but has a primary goal of advancing computing in the science and engineering fields.

Any technology that is significant enough to have open research problems is a candidate for OSRS and OSRS Open.

# Release Schedule

Each project sets its own release schedule and the greatest effort is made to ensure compatible version marches across projects.

## Released Versions

* See each individual project for more information

## Upcoming Ship Dates 

* See each individual project for more information

## Feedback

The best way to give feedback is to create issues in a project specific repo. 
For general feedback to OSRS Open, email us at: info at osrsopen dot com.  [OSRS Group](http://osrsopen.com)
For general feedback to OSRS Network, email us at: info at osrs dot network.  [OSRS Network](http://osrs.network)

Please give us feedback that will give us insight on the following points:

* Existing features that are missing some capability or otherwise don't work well enough.
* Missing features that should be added to the product.
* Design choices for a feature that is currently in-progress.

Some important caveats / notes:

* It is best to give design feedback quickly for improvements that are in-development. We're unlikely to hold a feature being part of a release on late feedback.
* We are most likely to include improvements that either have a positive impact on a broad scenario or have very significant positive impact on a niche scenario. This means that we are unlikely to prioritize modest improvements to niche scenarios.
* Compatibility will almost always be given a higher priority than improvements.

# Notes
OSRS Open is a community-driven organization, not a company.
OSRS Open is the fully public open source community hosting all OSRS Open projects. Anyone can participate in OSRS Open.
All OSRS Open projects are hosted in public repositories with OSI licensing (generally MIT or Apache 2.0).

OSRS Network is a community-driven organization, not a company.
OSRS Network is the organization that focuses on cross-organizational collaboration and funding of technology research. Many OSRS Network projects ultimately become OSRS Open projects.
OSRS Network additionally supports "private open source" projects, which are fully OSI licensed (generally MIT or Apache 2.0), but have private repositories which are open to all OSRS Network members.


Both OSRS Open and OSRS Network accept members to the organization as well as to individual projects as applicable.
OSRS Network caters to governmental organizations, non-profits, FFRDCs, Educational (universities and colleges) and other research and engineering institutions.
OSRS Network is focused on "sharing in kind" where participants are required to contribute a measurable value.
