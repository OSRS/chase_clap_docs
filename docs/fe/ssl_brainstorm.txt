	stats.appsflyer.com
	valid.apple.com

Similiar to (but not the same as) the host field in the http logs.

Possible feature ideas
- join on the cisco top 1m
- split on the '.'
	- count the number of sections
	- compute the frequency of the subparts ('virginia' would have a higher frequency)
	- get the tld, compute the frequency of the tld
	- as many of the made_domain features as possible
- join on ja3 blacklist


------ version

- compute frequencies

------ cipher

- compute frequencies


------ validation_status

- binary? (ok/ not ok)


------ subject/ issuer fields

Labels
