Requirements
- User can view known buckets from a database
- User can switch between different datasets
- User can categorize/ label points
- User can toggle the cluster mode
- Widget can be injected in any website (self contained)

Other possible requirements:
- Allow users to select a point in the visualization, which then replaces the widget interface
    with an info panel showing features of interest and other interesting statistics for that specific point

TODO
- Shrink size of the size of the visualization
- Figure out how to encapsulate the widget in a div that can be injected into a website
- Make the visualization "prettier"
- Implement the backend services (more specifically, the code for switching to cluster mode)
