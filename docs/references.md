| [Adversarial Training against Poisons and Backdoors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13624) | Data poisoning is a threat model in which a malicious actor tampers with training data to manipulate outcomes at inference time. A variety of defenses against this threat model have been proposed, but each suffers from at least one of the following flaws: they are easily overcome by adaptive attacks, they severely reduce testing performance, or they cannot generalize to diverse data poisoning threat models. Adversarial training, and its variants, is currently considered the only empirically strong defense against (inference-time) adversarial attacks. In this work, we extend the adversarial training framework to instead defend against (training-time) poisoning and backdoor attacks. Our method desensitizes networks to the effects of poisoning by creating poisons during training and injecting them into training batches. We show that this defense withstands adaptive attacks, generalizes to diverse threat models, and incurs a better performance trade-off than previous defenses.
| [Characterizing the Landscape of COVID-19 Themed Cyberattacks and Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13223) | COVID-19 (Coronavirus) hit the global society and economy with a big surprise. In particular, work-from-home has become a new norm for employees. Despite the fact that COVID-19 can equally attack innocent people and cybercriminals, it is ironic to see surges in cyberattacks leveraging COVID-19 as a theme, dubbed COVID-19 themed cyberattacks or COVID-19 attacks for short, which represent a new phenomenon that has yet to be systematically understood. In this paper, we make the first step towards fully characterizing the landscape of these attacks, including their sophistication via the Cyber Kill Chain model. We also explore the solution space of defenses against these attacks.
| [Data-Driven Characterization and Detection of COVID-19 Themed Malicious Websites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13226) | COVID-19 has hit hard on the global community, and organizations are working diligently to cope with the new norm of "work from home". However, the volume of remote work is unprecedented and creates opportunities for cyber attackers to penetrate home computers. Attackers have been leveraging websites with COVID-19 related names, dubbed COVID-19 themed malicious websites. These websites mostly contain false information, fake forms, fraudulent payments, scams, or malicious payloads to steal sensitive information or infect victims' computers. In this paper, we present a data-driven study on characterizing and detecting COVID-19 themed malicious websites. Our characterization study shows that attackers are agile and are deceptively crafty in designing geolocation targeted websites, often leveraging popular domain registrars and top-level domains. Our detection study shows that the Random Forest classifier can detect COVID-19 themed malicious websites based on the lexical and WHOIS features defined in this paper, achieving a 98% accuracy and 2.7% false-positive rate.
| [A Quantitative Metric for Privacy Leakage in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13472) | In the federated learning system, parameter gradients are shared among participants and the central modulator, while the original data never leave their protected source domain. However, the gradient itself might carry enough information for precise inference of the original data. By reporting their parameter gradients to the central server, client datasets are exposed to inference attacks from adversaries. In this paper, we propose a quantitative metric based on mutual information for clients to evaluate the potential risk of information leakage in their gradients. Mutual information has received increasing attention in the machine learning and data mining community over the past few years. However, existing mutual information estimation methods cannot handle high-dimensional variables. In this paper, we propose a novel method to approximate the mutual information between the high-dimensional gradients and batched input data. Experimental results show that the proposed metric reliably reflect the extent of information leakage in federated learning. In addition, using the proposed metric, we investigate the influential factors of risk level. It is proven that, the risk of information leakage is related to the status of the task model, as well as the inherent data distribution.
| [Classifier Calibration: with implications to threat scores in cybersecurity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05143) | This paper explores the calibration of a classifier output score in binary classification problems. A calibrator is a function that maps the arbitrary classifier score, of a testing observation, onto [0,1] to provide an estimate for the posterior probability of belonging to one of the two classes. Calibration is important for two reasons; first, it provides a meaningful score, that is the posterior probability; second, it puts the scores of different classifiers on the same scale for comparable interpretation. The paper presents three main contributions: (1) Introducing multi-score calibration, when more than one classifier provides a score for a single observation. (2) Introducing the idea that the classifier scores to a calibration process are nothing but features to a classifier, hence proposing extending the classifier scores to higher dimensions to boost the calibrator's performance. (3) Conducting a massive simulation study, in the order of 24,000 experiments, that incorporates different configurations, in addition to experimenting on two real datasets from the cybersecurity domain. The results show that there is no overall winner among the different calibrators and different configurations. However, general advices for practitioners include the following: the Platt's calibrator~\citep{Platt1999ProbabilisticOutputsForSupport}, a version of the logistic regression that decreases bias for a small sample size, has a very stable and acceptable performance among all experiments; our suggested multi-score calibration provides better performance than single score calibration in the majority of experiments, including the two real datasets. In addition, extending the scores can help in some experiments.
| [Edge-Detect: Edge-centric Network Intrusion Detection using Deep Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01873) | Edge nodes are crucial for detection against multitudes of cyber attacks on Internet-of-Things endpoints and is set to become part of a multi-billion industry. The resource constraints in this novel network infrastructure tier constricts the deployment of existing Network Intrusion Detection System with Deep Learning models (DLM). We address this issue by developing a novel light, fast and accurate 'Edge-Detect' model, which detects Distributed Denial of Service attack on edge nodes using DLM techniques. Our model can work within resource restrictions i.e. low power, memory and processing capabilities, to produce accurate results at a meaningful pace. It is built by creating layers of Long Short-Term Memory or Gated Recurrent Unit based cells, which are known for their excellent representation of sequential data. We designed a practical data science pipeline with Recurring Neural Network to learn from the network packet behavior in order to identify whether it is normal or attack-oriented. The model evaluation is from deployment on actual edge node represented by Raspberry Pi using current cybersecurity dataset (UNSW2015). Our results demonstrate that in comparison to conventional DLM techniques, our model maintains a high testing accuracy of 99% even with lower resource utilization in terms of cpu and memory. In addition, it is nearly 3 times smaller in size than the state-of-art model and yet requires a much lower testing time.
| [MalNet: A Large-Scale Cybersecurity Image Database of Malicious Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01072) | Computer vision is playing an increasingly important role in automated malware detection with to the rise of the image-based binary representation. These binary images are fast to generate, require no feature engineering, and are resilient to popular obfuscation methods. Significant research has been conducted in this area, however, it has been restricted to small-scale or private datasets that only a few industry labs and research teams have access to. This lack of availability hinders examination of existing work, development of new research, and dissemination of ideas. We introduce MalNet, the largest publicly available cybersecurity image database, offering 133x more images and 27x more classes than the only other public binary-image database. MalNet contains over 1.2 million images across a hierarchy of 47 types and 696 families. We provide extensive analysis of MalNet, discussing its properties and provenance. The scale and diversity of MalNet unlocks new and exciting cybersecurity opportunities to the computer vision community--enabling discoveries and research directions that were previously not possible. The database is publicly available at this http://www.mal-net.org/ URL.
| [Internet of Predictable Things (IoPT) Framework to Increase Cyber-Physical System Resiliency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07816) | During the last two decades, distributed energy systems, especially renewable energy sources (RES), have become more economically viable with increasing market share and penetration levels on power systems. In addition to decarbonization and decentralization of energy systems, digitalization has also become very important. The use of artificial intelligence (AI), advanced optimization algorithms, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and other digitalization frameworks makes modern power system assets more intelligent, while vulnerable to cybersecurity risks. This paper proposes the concept of the Internet of Predictable Things (IoPT) that incorporates advanced data analytics and machine learning methods to increase the resiliency of cyber-physical systems against cybersecurity risks. The proposed concept is demonstrated using a cyber-physical system testbed under a variety of cyber attack scenarios as a proof of concept (PoC).
| [An Isolation Forest Learning Based Outlier Detection Approach for Effectively Classifying Cyber Anomalies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03141) | Cybersecurity has recently gained considerable interest in today's security issues because of the popularity of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), the considerable growth of mobile networks, and many related apps. Therefore, detecting numerous cyber-attacks in a network and creating an effective intrusion detection system plays a vital role in today's security. In this paper, we present an Isolation Forest Learning-Based Outlier Detection Model for effectively classifying cyber anomalies. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the resulting Outlier Detection model, we also use several conventional machine learning approaches, such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost Classifier (ABC), Naive Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The effectiveness of our proposed Outlier Detection model is evaluated by conducting experiments on Network Intrusion Dataset with evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy of cyber anomalies has been improved after removing outliers.
| [Predicting Organizational Cybersecurity Risk: A Deep Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14425) | Cyberattacks conducted by malicious hackers cause irreparable damage to organizations, governments, and individuals every year. Hackers use exploits found on hacker forums to carry out complex cyberattacks, making exploration of these forums vital. We propose a hacker forum entity recognition framework (HackER) to identify exploits and the entities that the exploits target. HackER then uses a bidirectional long short-term memory model (BiLSTM) to create a predictive model for what companies will be targeted by exploits. The results of the algorithm will be evaluated using a manually labeled gold-standard test dataset, using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as metrics. We choose to compare our model against state of the art classical machine learning and deep learning benchmark models. Results show that our proposed HackER BiLSTM model outperforms all classical machine learning and deep learning models in F1-score (79.71%). These results are statistically significant at 0.05 or lower for all benchmarks except LSTM. The results of preliminary work suggest our model can help key cybersecurity stakeholders (e.g., analysts, researchers, educators) identify what type of business an exploit is targeting.
| [Machine Learning for Detecting Data Exfiltration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09344) | Context: Research at the intersection of cybersecurity, Machine Learning (ML), and Software Engineering (SE) has recently taken significant steps in proposing countermeasures for detecting sophisticated data exfiltration attacks. It is important to systematically review and synthesize the ML-based data exfiltration countermeasures for building a body of knowledge on this important topic. Objective: This paper aims at systematically reviewing ML-based data exfiltration countermeasures to identify and classify ML approaches, feature engineering techniques, evaluation datasets, and performance metrics used for these countermeasures. This review also aims at identifying gaps in research on ML-based data exfiltration countermeasures. Method: We used a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method to select and review {92} papers. Results: The review has enabled us to (a) classify the ML approaches used in the countermeasures into data-driven, and behaviour-driven approaches, (b) categorize features into six types: behavioural, content-based, statistical, syntactical, spatial and temporal, (c) classify the evaluation datasets into simulated, synthesized, and real datasets and (d) identify 11 performance measures used by these studies. Conclusion: We conclude that: (i) the integration of data-driven and behaviour-driven approaches should be explored; (ii) There is a need of developing high quality and large size evaluation datasets; (iii) Incremental ML model training should be incorporated in countermeasures; (iv) resilience to adversarial learning should be considered and explored during the development of countermeasures to avoid poisoning attacks; and (v) the use of automated feature engineering should be encouraged for efficiently detecting data exfiltration attacks.
| [Intrusion detection in computer systems by using artificial neural networks with Deep Learning approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08559) | Intrusion detection into computer networks has become one of the most important issues in cybersecurity. Attackers keep on researching and coding to discover new vulnerabilities to penetrate information security system. In consequence computer systems must be daily upgraded using up-to-date techniques to keep hackers at bay. This paper focuses on the design and implementation of an intrusion detection system based on Deep Learning architectures. As a first step, a shallow network is trained with labelled log-in [into a computer network] data taken from the Dataset CICIDS2017. The internal behaviour of this network is carefully tracked and tuned by using plotting and exploring codes until it reaches a functional peak in intrusion prediction accuracy. As a second step, an autoencoder, trained with big unlabelled data, is used as a middle processor which feeds compressed information and abstract representation to the original shallow network. It is proven that the resultant deep architecture has a better performance than any version of the shallow network alone. The resultant functional code scripts, written in MATLAB, represent a re-trainable system which has been proved using real data, producing good precision and fast response.
| [Using Side Channel Information and Artificial Intelligence for Malware Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03750) | Cybersecurity continues to be a difficult issue for society especially as the number of networked systems grows. Techniques to protect these systems range from rules-based to artificial intelligence-based intrusion detection systems and anti-virus tools. These systems rely upon the information contained in the network packets and download executables to function. Side channel information leaked from hardware has been shown to reveal secret information in systems such as encryption keys. This work demonstrates that side channel information can be used to detect malware running on a computing platform without access to the code involved.
| [Cyber-Attack Consequence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00648) | Cyber-physical systems posit a complex number of security challenges due to interconnection of heterogeneous devices having limited processing, communication, and power capabilities. Additionally, the conglomeration of both physical and cyber-space further makes it difficult to devise a single security plan spanning both these spaces. Cyber-security researchers are often overloaded with a variety of cyber-alerts on a daily basis many of which turn out to be false positives. In this paper, we use machine learning and natural language processing techniques to predict the consequences of cyberattacks. The idea is to enable security researchers to have tools at their disposal that makes it easier to communicate the attack consequences with various stakeholders who may have little to no cybersecurity expertise. Additionally, with the proposed approach researchers' cognitive load can be reduced by automatically predicting the consequences of attacks in case new attacks are discovered. We compare the performance through various machine learning models employing word vectors obtained using both tf-idf and Doc2Vec models. In our experiments, an accuracy of 60% was obtained using tf-idf features and 57% using Doc2Vec method for models based on LinearSVC model.
