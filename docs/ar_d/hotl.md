Human on the loop analytics

incorporate the analyst into the analytic by allowing them to select an item and give it a malicousness / benign-ness score

this goes in several directions as it can be "inside" an analytic or directly related to a feature (e.g. tag an FQDN as benign)


human can provie just a thumbs up / thumbs down for good/bad or some score (0->1)


ratings must be combinable with weights to provide a "merged" score

analysts should be able to rate each other (within an org)
organizations should be able to rate each other (within an org)
--cross-org ratings may be less sharable due to privacy
